# User Guide

## Overview

**BlackGoldAncientSword** is a Windows desktop application that automatically detects game status, recognizes teammates, and fetches real-time player stats. No need to alt-tab to a browser — stats are displayed directly on your desktop. Supports **Solo / Duo / Trio** modes and **Ranked / Casual / Immortal** match types.


## Player Stats

Enter a player nickname in the search box to fetch full stats:

- **Season overview**: K/D, first-place rate, top-5 rate, avg kills/heals/assists/survival
- **Best records**: Most kills, heals, assists, damage, parries
- **Rank info**: Current season rank score and tier name (with star count for celestial tier)
- **Recent 10 battles**: Hero, mode, kills/damage, rank score with ± delta, honor titles

Filter by season, mode category (Ranked / Casual / Immortal), and team size (Trio / Duo / Solo).

## FAQ 🧐

**Q: Will I get banned for using BlackGoldAncientSword? 😨**

This app only reads the game log file (Player.log) and captures the hero selection screen for OCR recognition. It does not modify or inject into game files or memory in any way. You are very unlikely to be banned, though no guarantee can be made.

**Q: Why can't I query stats / why is data delayed?**

All stats data comes from the same API powering https://naraka.drivod.top/ , provided by craftwyrd. The app only displays the data. If data is unavailable or delayed, the issue is almost certainly on the API server side.

**Q: Why does teammate recognition fail or show inaccurate results?**

OCR recognition uses the same underlying technology as OBS screen capture, capturing directly from the graphics card layer and bypassing any overlays. However, it currently only supports recognition when the screen and game resolutions match. If your screen resolution differs from the game resolution, black bars will appear on the sides — please avoid playing in such a setup. For best results, play in fullscreen at the highest resolution or at a resolution matching your display.

Additionally, OCR may sometimes fail to recognize certain special characters. If you encounter unrecognized names, you can use QQ screenshot text recognition or similar tools as a manual workaround.

## Core Module Details

### 1. MVVM Architecture (Prism + DryIoc)

- All ViewModels inherit from `ViewModelBase` with `RaisePropertyChanged()` (no `SetProperty` wrapper per project conventions)
- Property change notifications use `nameof()` or `[CallerMemberName]`, string literals forbidden
- Navigation via `IMainContentNavigationService` with forward/back support
- Cross-module communication via `IEventAggregator` (e.g. `TipMessageEvent`)

### 2. On-Demand Module Loading

Each of the 7 UI pages is a Prism `IModule` registered as `OnDemand` in `ModuleCatalogConfigManager`. Modules are only loaded on first navigation, reducing startup time.

```csharp
// PageNames.cs
public static class PageNames
{
    public const string HomePage     = nameof(HomePage);
    public const string StatsPage    = nameof(StatsPage);
    public const string SearchPage   = nameof(SearchPage);
    public const string TeamInfoPage = nameof(TeamInfoPage);
    public const string SettingsPage = nameof(SettingsPage);
    public const string AnnouncementPage = nameof(AnnouncementPage);
    public const string ClosePromptPage  = nameof(ClosePromptPage);
}
```

### 3. Game Status Monitoring (GameMonitor)

`GameLogMonitor` polls `Player.log` at intervals to detect game events:

- `BattleJoined` — hero selection (parses RoomId from log)
- `BattleStarted` — match start (parses BattleId)
- `BattleEnded` — match end

`GameStatusMonitor` maintains a state machine, notifying pages of the current phase. `HomePageViewModel` additionally uses `Process.GetProcessesByName("NarakaBladepoint")` as a secondary check.

### 4. Screen Capture & OCR (Team Info)

1. `GameStatusMonitor` detects `HeroSelection` state
2. `TeamInfoPageViewModel` starts OCR polling loop
3. `ScreenCaptureService` captures game window via **Windows Graphics Capture API** (native C++ DLL → SharpDX D3D11)
4. `OcrService` spawns **PaddleOCR-json.exe** to recognize Chinese text
5. `TeamInfoOcrService` parses OCR output and extracts teammate nicknames
6. Stats API is queried for each teammate, displayed side-by-side

### 5. Source-Generated HTTP Client

API clients are **not hand-written**. `BlackGoldAncientSword.Framework.SourceGenerator` reads JSON definitions from `Http/Definitions/*.json` at compile time and generates strongly-typed HTTP client code.

### 6. Localization

Multi-language support via WPF `ResourceDictionary`. All UI text is defined in `Strings.xx.xaml`. `ILocalizationService.ApplyLanguage()` dynamically swaps resource dictionaries at runtime — no restart needed.

### 7. Auto Updates (NetSparkle)

Background checks for new GitHub Releases. Update dialog is fully localized. Three options: skip, remind later, or download & install.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Single-file publish** | `PublishSingleFile=true` + `SelfContained=true`, single `.exe`, no .NET runtime install needed |
| **No SetProperty** | ViewModel base only exposes `RaisePropertyChanged`, avoiding over-encapsulation |
| **No property name strings** | Must use `nameof()` or `[CallerMemberName]` for property change notifications |
| **Allman brace style** | All C# code uses Allman style (braces on own line) |
| **Chinese commit messages** | All git commits in Chinese with detailed descriptions |
| **Source-generated API clients** | Reduces hand-written HTTP code, ensures type safety |
| **OnDemand modules** | Non-initial modules load on demand, improving startup time |
